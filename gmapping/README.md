## Gmapping
Gmapping files in main here are used for final presentation.

The following launch file will launch gmapping, static_tf, and laser_scan_matcher
``` 
roslaunch robot2.launch
```
The following launch filw will launch move_base along with RVIZ and the 3D model.
```
roslaunch base.launch
```
Note: the 3D model will not work, but the 3D file is available, a little bit of research will be enough to figure it out.
